 A program is needed to allow a Wildlife Park to sell tickets. A booking consists of one or more
 tickets for the same day(s) and can be made up to a week in advance. A booking can be made
 for a visit of one day or two consecutive days. A booking can have extra attractions included. A
 booking will be valid for the day(s) chosen only. Write and test a program or programs for the Wildlife Park:
 Your program or programs must include appropriate prompts for the entry of data. Data
 must be validated on entry.
 All outputs, including error messages, need to be set out clearly and understandably.
 All variables, constants and other identifiers must have meaningful names
